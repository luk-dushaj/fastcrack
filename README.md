# fastcrack

A cross platform simple commandline utility for cracking zip files
Inspired by Zip Cracker from the [CyberSecurity tools repo](https://github.com/king04aman/CyberSecurity-Tools)

On average it is **60% faster** or more than the python implementation and it comes bundled with **rockyou.txt** for max portability.
